# ECE455
Real Time Computer Systems Design Project

## Traffic Light Project
The traffic light system implemented using FreeRTOS displayed on a STM32F4 board. The final design used a variety of FreeRTOS features such as queues, tasks, and timers. This was built to fulfil the project requirements of the first ECE 455 project.
